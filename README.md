# A look at the adjusting closing price of stocks from January 1, 2015 to September 28, 2015

## Overview

This repo contains a problem that was given to me during an interview. Since the problem was kind of cool, I wanted to write about it.

The purpose of this assignment was to find the S&P stock with the highest adjusting close price standard deviation for the period January 1, 2015 until September 28, 2015 .


## Tools used

* Python (and Pandas)
* R's `rvest` library for scraping the stock lists.


## About the repo

Besides the readme, this repo has 3 files. 

* `highest_adjclose_sddev.py` is the main file. This is the Python code used for answering the question
* `scrape_stocks_list.R` is the R code for scraping the list of stocks
* `stocks_list.txt` is the list of stocks.
